This was a program intended to sharpen photos using two different matrix filters. One is 3x3 and one is 5x5.

Problems I encountered:
  Debugging a visual image can be difficult to conceptualize. At one point I had a problem with
  two filters getting applied to the same image but I couldn't be sure so I purposely made half the pixels red in one 
  function and the other half red in another to verify which were being applied. I also tried to rework 
  functions from PA1 with vectors but ran into a performance time issue so I abandoned that for now. 

Thoughts on the assignment:
  I enjoyed this assignment. I enjoy the object oriented paradigm in programming. Being able to create a class and then later
  create more functions to work with the existing classes is an efficient way of programming. This project was very modular and 
  I liked that. It made it easy to program and compile in pieces.
