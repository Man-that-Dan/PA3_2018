Programming assignment intended to apply filters images using derived classes built in c++



This was a program intended to sharpen photos using two different matrix filters. One is 3x3 and one is 5x5.

Problems I encountered:
  Sepia filter apply algorithm was difficult to debug as I didn't completely understand the process at the time.
  Menu logic is difficult to make dynamic with more than just filter classes. For the scope of this assignment, I didn't try 
  to make it compatible with other applications. It is, however, dynamic in that the list of filters can be set in the 
  construction.
