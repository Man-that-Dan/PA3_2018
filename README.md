This was a program intended to sharpen photos using two different matrix filters. One is 3x3 and one is 5x5.

Problems I encountered:
  Sepia filter apply algorithm was difficult to debug as I didn't completely understand the process at the time.
  Menu logic is difficult to make dynamic with more than just filter classes. For the scope of this assignment, I didn't try 
  to make it compatible with other applications. It is, however, dynamic in that the list of filters can be set in the 
  construction. 

Thoughts on the assignment:
  This project both took longer than PA2 and yet was easier. Since I was creating derived classes, I already had a base
  to start from. I realize there are a lot of benefits to abstraction with objects in object oriented programming.
